# HaxBall Bot

This repository has been designed to help people who do not know how to code to be able to host a room with multiple options.
It currently contains 5 levels, which all have their own specifications.

## Level 0

It's the skeleton for the bot, if you want to start building your own bot, it's what you need to start your project.

## Level 1

This level is the minimum we can expect from a haxball bot.

 - Updating teams
 - Giving admin when there's a need of them
 - Join, time, goal and win notifications

And finally I added the ball speed, which is pretty cool. I'd recommand this level to people who wants to have a minimalist bot.

## Level 2

This level adds some pretty cool features.

 - Possession
 - GK of each team
 - Admins options : mute system and clearbans

I recommand this over the Level 1 bot since it's still handy to use. The next levels will be more advanced.

## Level 3

This is where the more interesting stuff starts. Check the changelist below :

 - **Global** statistics system with login
 - Inactivity handler
 - AFK system
 - Admin options : clearing specific bans via the ban list, slow mode

These are pretty heavy changes. If you're interested in getting this bot (or the Level 4 bot), check out the Global Statistics System below. I recommand getting this bot if you're interested in having global statistics and still want to have people handling the room. 

## Level 4

This is the final level, the bot becomes self sufficient :

 - End game handler
 - Choose system

That's it ! Choose this level if you want to have a very advanced room and don't want to handle the basic things.

# Current situation

I'm working on this bot on a regular basis. However, some of the bots may have issues. If you encounter one of them, just open an issue. I'll be resolving them as fast as I can.
The future changes will be : 

 - Finishing this MD
 - Enhancing the mute system
 - Creating the functions folder
 - Enhancing the goal attribution
 - Publishing the Real Soccer Bot
 - Using the haxilium project by @olegmisar

On to explaining some systems which deserve to be detailed.
