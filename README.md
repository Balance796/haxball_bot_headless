Functions to enhance your haxball bot!

# Content of this repository

You will have every function useful to implement your bot but also 5 complete bots which will have different level of autonomy. I will make 5 different models, which correspond to the levels for the autonomous car :

Level 0: No assistance whatsoever from the bot

Level 1 : Some assistance, but most of the work is still done by hand.

Level 2 : Great assistance from the bot, half the job done by hand.

Level 3 : The bot helps a lot, but human assistance still needed

Level 4 : The bot takes over
